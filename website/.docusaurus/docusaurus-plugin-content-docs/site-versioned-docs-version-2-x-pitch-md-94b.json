  "description": "It's useful when considering whether or not to use a project to understand the tradeoffs that the developers of the project made when building it. What problems does it explicitly try to solve for you, and which ones does it ignore? What are the current limitations of the project and common problems that people encounter? These are the kinds of questions that we believe you should have answers to when making an important technology decision for your project, and so we have documented answers to these questions as best we can here, in the form of a \"pitch\" (why you should use it) and \"anti-pitch\" (why you should not use it). Please [submit a pull request](https://github.com/react-navigation/website) if you believe we have omitted important information!",
