  "description": "This guide explores possible way to use React Navigation in a React Native project that uses [MobX State Tree](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-state-tree)(MST) for state management. The guide is accompanied by a [sample app](https://github.com/vonovak/react-navigation-mst-demo). Parts of the guide may be relevant also for users of [MobX](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx) but please be aware of the fact that MobX does not come with a built-in solution for (de)serializing its state.",
